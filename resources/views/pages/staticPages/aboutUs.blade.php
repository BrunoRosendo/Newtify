        <p>
            We are an era of technology growth, but with it the amount of incorrect information on the internet and
            media algo grows. It becomes increasingly complicated to filter the information that is correct, and knowledge proof
            is often required for our disclosures to be legitimate, proofs that aren't always easy to get.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is the reason why our team of four 3rd year L.EIC students decided to create Newtify!
        </p>

        <p>
            On this application, users are the experts which will evaluate our proofs, by giving 
            their feedbacks and suggestions. Newtify brings a new reality where person's practical knowledge takes the place of
            theoretical knowledge and where your opinion is used to evaluate others reliability! Newtify is the way to decrease the 
            amount of fake news that we have nowadays.
        </p>

        <p>
            Help us to create a new honest world where information is legit and we can learn with each other by 
            joining us!
        </p>
